This research analyzes sentiment dynamics in Redditâ€™s network of subreddits through the lens of hyperlinks, with the objective of predicting inter-community relations and identifying potential conflicts. Previous works have explored textual similarity and troll-like behaviors within communities but lacked the predictive capacity for future interactions. Our methodology employs the JODIE and GraphSAGE models, integrating dynamic and static embeddings via recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks respectively. These models adeptly manage the temporal and structural complexities inherent in subreddit interactions. The performance of our models shows significant potential in capturing the nuanced dynamics of subreddit interactions, offering insights that could improve community management and moderation tools. Our results advocate for the integration of advanced embedding and multimedia content to deepen the understanding of online communities, paving the way for more robust and insightful analyses that can inform the decisions of moderators, social scientists, and policymakers.
